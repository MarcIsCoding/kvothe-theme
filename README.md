# Kvothe Theme for VS Code

[Install from VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MarcGarside.theme-kvothe)

![Preview](https://github.com/MarcIsCoding/kvothe-theme/blob/main/images/ss.png?raw=true)

This project is essentially an experiment to transpose the aesthetic of my terminal to my code editor.

Drawing inspiration from the deep contrasts and vibrant hues of the [PowerLevel10K Theme](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) for Oh My Zsh, and building on Wes Bos' [Cobalt2 theme](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2-vscode) (refer to the included license), the Kvothe theme offers a high-contrast dark theme for VS Code. It features a palette that accentuates dark blues alongside vivid, high-contrast greens.

## Installation

- Navigate to the Extensions sidebar panel in VS Code.
