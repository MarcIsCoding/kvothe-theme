# Kvothe Theme for VS Code

Basically an experiment to bring my terminal feel to my code editor.

Inspired by the deep contrasts and vibrant hues of the [PowerLevel10K Theme](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) for Oh My Zsh and built upon Wes Bos' [Cobalt2 theme](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2-vscode) (see included license), the Kvothe theme is a high contrast dark theme for vscode. Featuring a palette that emphasizes dark blues and vivid, high-contrast greens.
